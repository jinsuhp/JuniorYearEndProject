Problem:

Create a webpage layout for the two pages from pictures HomePage.png and GenresPage. 

You don't need to rewrite everything. You should copy most of the Javascript code, some HTML and CSS from the classwork from lesson 51 and this lesson..

You will need to tweak some of the Javascript, CSS and HTML to incorporate the city flags.
